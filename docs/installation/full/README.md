# Running both the back-end and the front-end.

To run the back-end and the front-end simultaneously, you could either use Docker with docker-compose, two separate Docker containers, or run them without Docker.

Your options for running both the back-end and front-end comes down to this:

- [Run both as one single package with docker-compose.](without-docker.md)

- [Run both separately with Docker.](with-docker.md)

- Run both separately without Docker.

- [Instructions for the front-end.](../frontend-only/without-docker.md)
